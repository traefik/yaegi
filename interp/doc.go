/*
Package interp provides a complete Go interpreter.

For the Go language itself, refer to the official Go specification
https://golang.org/ref/spec.

# Importing packages

Packages can be imported in source or binary form, using the standard
Go import statement. In source form, packages are searched first in the
vendor directory, the preferred way to store source dependencies. If not
found in vendor, sources modules will be searched in GOPATH.

Binary form packages are compiled and linked with the interpreter
executable, and exposed to scripts with the Use method. The extract
subcommand of yaegi can be used to generate package wrappers.

# Custom build tags

Custom build tags allow to control which files in imported source
packages are interpreted, in the same way as the "-tags" option of the
"go build" command. Setting a custom build tag spans globally for all
future imports of the session.

A build tag is a line comment that begins

	// yaegi:tags

that lists the build constraints to be satisfied by the further
imports of source packages.

For example the following custom build tag

	// yaegi:tags noasm

Will ensure that an import of a package will exclude files containing

	// +build !noasm

And include files containing

	// +build noasm
